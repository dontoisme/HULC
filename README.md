# HULC
Hogan's Ultimage Oil Calculator

## Goals
The goals of the HULC are to webify a tool that my Grandpa has been using for years in his work. It's fairly simple, but when the price of oil went above $99 a barrel his tool became useless. My family has made several attempts at this tool, and its kind of becoming a "hello world" for our family. This is my take on is using the tools that I like (Meteor, Atmosphere, SASS) and an attempt to learn a new one (FamousJS).
